## 🧭 Our Mission

At Elf Academy, we believe that learning how to *work* is just as important as learning how to *code*. We’re building a creative, non-traditional platform where students learn at their own pace and apply their knowledge through real projects, supported by AI-driven guidance every step of the way.
